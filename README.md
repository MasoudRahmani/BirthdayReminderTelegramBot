# BirthdayReminderTelegramBot

This Bot Get users Birthdays from a google spreadsheet and send HBD to a group which user are a member of.\

## "Is user member of" is not implemented yet. 

This is due to telegram limitaion to get members of group or channel.

And we can not resolve a user **UserName** to Unique Telegram id. (to work around it) normal way **require** for each member to **interact** with BOT.

**BUT** there is a way to resolve user id via 3rd party plugin which is build on something that is **depricated**. (hope it contiue to work.)
